# how to run files above

We want to compare the efficiency (the time used) of two ways
+ nested loop
+ modify merge sort

Steps:

1. run create_ran.py, it will create random integer and output "testdata.txt"
2. run inversion.c, it will read "testdata.txt" and output "result.txt"
3. run plot.py, it will read "result.txt" and plot
